First of all, to start programming a memory game with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I would need to begin by creating an HTML layout with a grid of cards using <div> elements. Style the cards and the game board with CSS to make it look nice and responsive. And then in JavaScript, manage the game logic by tracking which cards are clicked and checking for matches. Ofcourse incongruent cards will be programmed to disappear shortly after their selection. And if the player selects 2 matching cards the 2 divs would be programmed to permanently disappear until the game is reset. Finally, I will ensure to add event listeners to respond to user clicks. Some bonuses that I may add could include adding a functional timer at the top to see how quick players can be in matching all the cards on the grid.
